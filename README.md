## Getting Started

To view a list of banners and edit them, you can access the Optio Banners API. The API provides CRUD operations, allowing you to find banners, view details, and make updates. To access the application's banner list, you can create a separate page that displays the data retrieved from the API, enabling users to filter and search for specific banners.

## Banner List Page

Create a page to display a list of banners using data from the Optio Banners API. This page should provide information about each banner, including the image, title, status, zone, start and end dates, and labels. You can implement features such as paging and sorting to make it easy for users to navigate through the banner list. Additionally, include a search feature to filter the list based on specific criteria.

## Banner Editing Form

For adding and editing banners, you can use a form that appears in a drawer or modal window when a user clicks on a banner in the list. This form should allow users to:

- Upload an image
- Set the title
- Choose the display zone
- Assign labels
- Set start and end dates
- And more

Images can be uploaded using Optio's Blobs API, and zones and labels can be retrieved via Optio's Reference Data API.
